						<p>
						The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are <b>fever, dry cough, and tiredness</b>. Other symptoms that are less common and may affect some patients include <b>aches and pains, nasal congestion, headache, conjunctivitis, sore throat, diarrhea, loss of taste or smell or a rash on skin or discoloration of fingers or toes</b>. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but only have very mild symptoms.
						</p>
						<p>
						Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. Around 1 out of every 5 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, or cancer, are at higher risk of developing serious illness.  However, anyone can catch COVID-19 and become seriously ill.  <b>People of all ages who experience fever and/or  cough associated withdifficulty breathing/shortness of breath, chest pain/pressure, or loss of speech or movement should seek medical attention immediately</b>. If possible, it is recommended to call the health care provider or facility first, so the patient can be directed to the right clinic.

						<p id="text1">
							Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div id="prevention2">
						<img src="./resources/keep_social_distancing_6ft.svg" alt="Keep_distance" id="image2">
						<p id="text2">
							Maintain at least 2 metre (6 feet) distance between yourself and others. Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person has the disease.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div id="prevention3">
						<img src="./resources/avoid_public_crowd.svg" alt="Avoid_public_crowd" id="image3">
						<p id="text3">
							Avoid going to crowded places. Why? Where people come together in crowds, you are more likely to come into close contact with someone that has COIVD-19 and it is more difficult to maintain physical distance of 1 metre (3 feet).
						</p>
					</div>
					<div id="prevention4">
						<img src="./resources/avoid_touch_eyes_mouth_face.svg" alt="" id="image4">
						<p id="text4">
							Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and infect you.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div id="prevention5">
						<img src="./resources/call_doctor_hospital.svg" alt="seek_medical_attention" id="image5">
						<p id="text5">
							If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention, but call by telephone in advance if possible and follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div id="prevention6">
						<img src="./resources/stay_home.svg" alt="Stay_home" id="image6">
						<p id="text6">
							Stay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, until you recover. Have someone bring you supplies. If you need to leave your house, wear a mask to avoid infecting others. Why? Avoiding contact with others will protect them from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.
						</p>

					<div id="prevention7">
						<img src="./resources/news_virus_update.svg" alt="be_updated" id="image7">
						<p id="text7">
							Keep up to date on the latest information from trusted sources, such as WHO or your local and national health authorities. Why? Local and national authorities are best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect themselves.
